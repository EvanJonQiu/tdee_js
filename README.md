## BMR formular
### The Original Harris-Benedict Equation
- Men BMR = 66.4730 + (13.7516 x weight in kg) + (5.0033 x height in cm) – (6.7550 x age in years)
- Women BMR = 655.0955 + (9.5634 x weight in kg) + (1.8496 x height in cm) – (4.6756 x age in years)
### The Revised Harris-Benedict Equation
- Men BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677 x age in years)
- Women BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) - (4.330 x age in years)
### The Mifflin St Jeor Equation
- Men BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5 (measured in Kcal/day)
- Women BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) - 161 (measured in Kcal/day)
### The Katch-McArdle Formula (Resting Daily Energy Expenditure)
- BMR = 370 + (21.6 x LBM) - LBM = lean body mass in Kg
### The Cunningham Formula (RMR)
- BMR = 500 + (22 x LBM) - LBM = lean body mass in Kg

## TDEE formular
- If you rarely exercise, multiply your BMR by 1.2
- If you exercise on 1 to 3 days per week, multiply your BMR by 1.375
- If you exercise on 3 to 5 days per week, multiply your BMR by 1.55
- If you exercise 6 to 7 days per week, multiply your BMR by 1.725
- If you exercise every day and have a physical job or if you often exercise twice a day, multiply your BMR by 1.9
